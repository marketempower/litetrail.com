### Worn/Carried

Clothing and gear that is worn or carried separate from your backpack. Typically, this is your hiking clothing, shoes, watch, and trekking poles.

The items in this section aren't included in *Base Pack* weight, and should only include the primary items you actually wear and carry outside your backpack. Resist the temptation to "hide" gear, for example your mobile phone shouldn't be included in this section.
