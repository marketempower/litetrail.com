<p><strong>Usage Tip</strong>: NyloPro multiuse bags are meant to be used as a liner inside a more durable stuff sack or canister, such as those made from DCF or silnylon. Though the material is very durable, they are not designed to be used alone.</p>

<p><strong>Note</strong>: Water resistant, not waterproof. In high humidity or when exposed to direct contact with water over extended periods of time (~8 hours), this film could transmit a hint of moisture. This can be a good thing, because unlike a fully water proof material, NyloPro bags "breath" in terms of water vapor (not scent) and allow the contents to dry out on their own.</p>
