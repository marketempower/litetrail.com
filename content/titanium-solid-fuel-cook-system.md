<p>The Titanium Solid Fuel Cook System contains everything you need for a complete <em>~3 oz</em> ultralight cook kit with a 550 mL capacity. Designed as one unit, to work together as a whole, our cook system includes a super ultralight (SUL) cookpot with or without handles and lid, solid fuel stove / stand, wind screen, ground protection and a <em>premium</em> Cuben Fiber storage stuff sack.</p>

<h3>What's New / Improved for v3</h3>

<ul>
  <li><strong>New stronger wind screen and ground protector</strong>: Slightly thicker ti-foil results in what we feel is the perfect balance between durability and weight.</li>
  <li><strong>New wind screen design</strong>: Non-fixed slide-lock closure so you can "roll" the wind screen up inside the cookpot walls and claim 100% of the interior space for storing other items. No paperclips, no spot-welds. Updated height, now 5mm taller for more protection from the elements.</li>
  <li><strong>Adjusted heat resistant tubing position</strong>: The heat resistant tubing on the handles has been shortened slightly so the flame does not burn the lower portion.</li>
  <li><strong>New stuffsack color</strong>: The color of the stuffsack is a light OD green in the same 0.75oz cuben weight as before, with a "camo" pull-tab.</li>
  <li><strong>New stuffsack cordlock</strong>: The stuffsack features a new cordlock that is almost weightless and pretty cool. We call it a curly cordlock and don't think you've ever seen it.</li>
  <li><strong>New Mini BIC premium lighter included</strong>*: We've made the "system" more complete by adding a fuel ignition source.</li>
  <li><strong>Included 3 genuine Esbit brand 14g Fuel tabs</strong>*: Enough fuel for a quick overnighter or weekend for hardcore hikers.</li>
  <li><strong>NEW v3 Cook System TOTAL Weight</strong>: 3.40 oz Handles / 2.97 No Handles (+-0.20 oz)</li>
</ul>
