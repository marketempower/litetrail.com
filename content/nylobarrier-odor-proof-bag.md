<p>NyloBarrier Odor Proof bags are the perfect ultralight storage solution for the scented items you bring into the outdoors. Made from an ultra durable plastic film for long life and sized just right for most commercial bear bags and canisters, these OP sacks will shave ounces off your gear list and save you money.</p>

<p>Until now, there has been only one solution for storing scented items in the outdoors. While effective, the existing method is more expensive, prone to zip closure failure and weigh 3x more compared to our NyloBarrier Odor Proof bags.</p>

<p><strong>Usage Tip</strong>: Our odor proof bags are meant to be used as a liner inside a more durable bear bagging stuff sack or canister, such as those made from cuben fiber or silnylon. Though the material is very durable, they are not designed to be used alone.</p>

<p><strong>NOTE</strong>: Water resistant, not water proof. In high humidity or when exposed to direct contact with water over extended periods of time (~8 hours), this film could transmit a hint of moisture. This can be a good thing, because unlike a fully water proof material, NyloBarrier bags "breath" in terms of water vapor (not scent) and allow the contents to dry out on their own.</p>
